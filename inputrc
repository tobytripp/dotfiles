# By default up/down are bound to previous-history and next-history
# respectively. The following does the same but gives the extra
# functionality where if you type any text (or more accurately, if
# there is any text between the start of the line and the cursor), the
# subset of the history starting with that text is searched (like 4dos
# for e.g.).
# Note to get rid of a line just Ctrl-C

"\e[B": history-search-forward
"\e[A": history-search-backward

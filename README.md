Toby's dotfiles
===============

My UNIX dotfiles bared for the world to see.

Installation
------------

    git clone https://github.com/tobytripp/dotfiles.git dotfiles
    cd dotfiles
    ruby install.rb

alternatively:

    bash < <( curl https://github.com/tobytripp/dotfiles/raw/master/local-install.sh )


Remote Server Installation
--------------------------

The repository contains a script for setting up some bare-bones
dotfiles on remote servers.  These files include things like screen
configuration, a simple bashrc, and the sort.

Install with:
    bash < <( curl https://github.com/tobytripp/dotfiles/raw/master/remote-install.sh )

This just clones or updates the repository and links back bashrc and screenrc.


Host-specific Settings
----------------------

Bash settings specific to a particular host may be stored in
`$HOME/.hostname`.  Any files in that directory will be sourced by
`.bashrc` when logged into that host.

* Toby's dotfiles

  My UNIX dotfiles bared for the world to see.

** Installation

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   git clone https://github.com/tobytripp/dotfiles.git dotfiles
   cd dotfiles
   ruby install.rb
   #+END_SRC

   alternatively:

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   bash < <( curl https://github.com/tobytripp/dotfiles/raw/master/local-install.sh )
   #+END_SRC

   But don't do that.  Piping strange scripts into your shell is
   stupid.  Don't.  Just don't.

** Remote Server Installation

   The repository contains a script for setting up some bare-bones
   dotfiles on remote servers.  These files include things like screen
   configuration, a simple bashrc, and the sort.

   It can be installed with (but see above):

   #+BEGIN_SRC sh
   bash < <( curl https://github.com/tobytripp/dotfiles/raw/master/remote-install.sh )
   #+END_SRC

   This just clones or updates the repository and links back bashrc and screenrc.


** Host-specific Settings

   Bash settings specific to a particular host may be stored in
   `$HOME/.hostname`.  Any files in that directory will be sourced by
   `.bashrc` when logged into that host.
